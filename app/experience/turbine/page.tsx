                I had the incredible opportunity to be part of SolanaTurbine, an
                intensive cohort designed for builders pushing the limits of
                whatâ€™s possible on Solana. Successfully graduating from the
                Builders' Cohort, all are cracked dev there from mentor to
                student everyone and also shipped a capstone project-Nestfolio:
                an AI DAO Governance.
