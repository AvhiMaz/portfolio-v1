**introducing nestfolio**: ai-powered dao governance.

this project was a part of [solanaturbin3](https://turbin3.com/) builders' cohort, in these cohort we wrote 7-8 programs with anchor and to graduate we have to submit a project (capstone), all the details of the project can be viewed in [github](https://github.com/4rjunc/nestfolio).

build with [arjun](https://x.com/4rjunc) and [amal](https://x.com/amal_kanhangad).

you can view the [tweet here](https://x.com/avhidotsol/status/1906715880639316454). the code is open-sourced and available on github ([smart-contract & ai-agent](https://github.com/4rjunc/nestfolio) / [web](https://github.com/AvhiMaz/nestfolio-web)), and the smart contract is deployed on devnet and the frontend is deployed on [vercel](https://vercel.com/) .
