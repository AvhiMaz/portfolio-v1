**introducing viralxpost**: let our ai tool help you create engaging content that breaks through the noise and gets you seen by the right people.

this project was created in collaboration with one of my childhood developer friends, [pawan](https://x.com/near0lx), before attending the solana hacker house, as we needed a project to showcase at the event to everyone.

the code is open-sourced and available on [github](https://github.com/viralxpost/viralxpost-web), deployed on [vercel](https://vercel.com/), and hereâ€™s the [live link](https://www.viralxpost.xyz/).

and yes, the backend is down as it is deployed on [render](https://render.com/). it needs to be upgraded!
